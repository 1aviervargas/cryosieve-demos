 === RELION MPI setup ===
 + Number of MPI processes             = 3
 + Master  (0) runs on host            = localhost.localdomain
 + Slave     1 runs on host            = localhost.localdomain
 + Slave     2 runs on host            = localhost.localdomain
 =================
 + Setting pixel size in output STAR file to 1.053 Angstroms
 + Re-extracting particles based on coordinates from input _data.star file 
 + ./Select/job065/particles.star
 + And re-centering particles based on refined coordinates in the _data.star file
