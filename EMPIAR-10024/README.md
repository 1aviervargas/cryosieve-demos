# EMPIAR-10024

We encourage you to access and download the dataset named "Human TRPA1 ion channel with agonist AITC" [(EMPIAR-10024)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-10024/) from the EMPIAR database. For optimal results, we advise focusing on the final stack specifically: `trpa1.mrcs` and `trpa1.star`. `trpa1_CryoSPARC_refined.star` was refined from `trpa1.star` using CryoSPARC to mitigate the effects brought about by advancements in orientation estimation techniques.

This scenario exemplifies the utilization of `cryosieve`. The case in point is configured to use the SLURM job manager system, leveraging 4 GPUs within a single node. Please note that you have the flexibility to modify the operational method to match your particular execution environment. Bear in mind, however, that to run `cryosieve`, the presence of Relion executables is mandatory.
