# EMPIAR-11233

We encourage you to access and download the dataset named "TRPM8 bound to calcium, processed stack from final reconstruction" (EMPIAR-11233) from the EMPIAR database. For optimal results, we advise focusing on the final stack specifically: `diver2019_pmTRPM8_calcium_Krios_6Feb18_finalParticleStack_EMPIAR_stack.mrcs` and `diver2019_pmTRPM8_calcium_Krios_6Feb18_finalParticleStack_EMPIAR_composite.star`.

This scenario exemplifies the utilization of `cryosieve`. The case in point is configured to use the SLURM job manager system, leveraging 4 GPUs within a single node. Please note that you have the flexibility to modify the operational method to match your particular execution environment. Bear in mind, however, that to run `cryosieve`, the presence of Relion executables is mandatory.
